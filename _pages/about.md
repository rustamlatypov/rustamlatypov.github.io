A fourth-year PhD student, advised by <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~uittoj3/">Jara Uitto</a>. I am broadly interested in algorithm design and combinatorics. My specific research interests lie in the mathematical foundations of distributed and parallel computing. So far, my work has focused on graph coloring and connectivity problems in massively parallel models.<br/>

I am enjoying parental leave with our daughter Liana until January 2025.<br/><br/>
