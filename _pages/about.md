A second-year PhD student, advised by Prof. Jara Uitto. Funded by the Computer Science department's competitive funding grant.

Interested in the mathematical foundations of distributed systems and parallel computing, with an emphasis on the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model. Current research revolves around charting the complexity landscape of fundamental graph problems (locally checkable labeling problems), and exploring the algorithmic applications of powerful probabilistic tools (e.g., Lov√°sz local lemma) in the context of MPC. Other interests include graph algorithms, graph theory and optimization.

Always up for new topics and collaboration.<br/>
